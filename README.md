And the live version of this app [here](https://www.muninn.co.uk/)  
Portfolio entry to follow soon.  

This part of the app is built with React & TailwindCSS, using Vite.  

Libraries required:  

`axios`  
`luxon`  
`react-google-recaptcha-v3`  
`react-hot-toast`  
`react-markdown`  
`remark-gfm`  
`react-router-dom`  

For the upload script I use for CI/CD using Gitea Actions.  
`dotenv`  
`ssh2-sftp-client`  

Additional dev dependencies (over and above those added by Vite).  
`@tailwindcss/forms`  
`@tailwindcss/typography`  
`autoprefixer`  
`postcss`  
`tailwindcss`  

All of the content (mostly) for this public facing app is managed via the admin panel. The code for all parts of this project are still very much work in progress.  

Mirrored from my private, self-hosted Gitea repositories, unfortunately it doesn't seem GitHub includes commits/PR etc., for mirrored repos in the activity graph.
